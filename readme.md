I have been offered a job with the IRS and I start this Tuesday March 22,  2016. I would like to continue the Bitwise class however per the rules I cannot have a job while staying in this workshop nor can I be off aid while staying in this workshop. I would like to thank you for the opportunity and all the help from the Bitwise instructors. I have enjoyed learning and growing in the workshop and feel that to the right person this class can be extremely beneficial. 
I will be returning any and all equipment today.

Thank you for everything.

Hey Climate, there's been a change of plans. There was a situation that occurred this weekend that resulted in my removal of my county case. There for I am no longer eligible to attend that awesome experience and knowledge I have learned there with you. But I'm going to continue coding here at home and try to learn new methods. 

At this time job I've accepted a job so that I can pay for the courses there at Bitwise and continue my education in coding.
